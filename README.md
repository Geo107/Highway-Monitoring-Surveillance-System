# ðŸš¨Highway Maintenance & Surveillance System.ðŸš¨

Highway Maintenance & Surveillance System. is an innovative project aimed at enhancing road safety by leveraging state-of-the-art object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) and seamless communication through the Twilio API. 

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

Highway Maintenance & Surveillance System. continuously monitors road environments in real-time using YOLO, a deep learning-based algorithm capable of detecting various objects, including vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles. Upon detecting an accident, it swiftly triggers an emergency notification to designated helpline centers via the Twilio API.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Real-time Accident Detection:** Highway Maintenance & Surveillance System. utilizes YOLO to detect accidents as they occur, ensuring prompt response.
- **Twilio Integration:** Seamless integration with Twilio API enables instant notification to emergency helpline centers.
- **Customizable Notification Settings:** Easily configure notification preferences and recipient details to suit your requirements.
- **Scalable and Robust:** Built with scalability and reliability in mind, HIghway Maintenance & Surveillance System. ensures consistent performance even under high traffic conditions.

## Extra Features

- **Accessing Multiple Centre:** This project allows user to add multiple helpline numbers, Here when accident is detected it will inform Hospital and when fire is detected it will inform Fire Station.
- **Allowing Changes on 'conf':** You could play with 'conf' attribute if you want more precision.
